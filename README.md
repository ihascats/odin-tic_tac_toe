A classic strategy game also known as "noughts and crosses" or "Xs and Os". The objective of the game is to be the first player to get three of your symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.</p>

<h2>How to Play</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Select "X" or "O" and whether you wanna play against your friend or a CPU, press start when ready</li>
  <li>On the game board, you will see a 3x3 grid of squares. One player will be "X" and the other will be "O"</li>
  <li>Players take turns placing their symbol on the board. "X" goes first</li>
  <li>To place your symbol, click on an empty square on the board. Your symbol will appear on the square</li>
  <li>The game continues until one player gets three of their symbols in a row or all squares are filled and the game is a draw</li>
  <li>If a player gets three in a row, they win the game. If the game ends in a draw, it is considered a tie</li>
</ol>
